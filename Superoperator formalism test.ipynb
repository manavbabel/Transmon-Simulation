    "# Superoperator Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I present a way to represent the effect of a pulse as a matrix, massively speeding up computation, and allowing more detailed error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a recounting of the basics, considering a single $n$-level qubit. A pure state (ket) of this qubit $\\ket{\\psi}$ exists in an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space, and is represented by a vector of length $n$. An operator is a map from $\\mathcal{H}_n\\to\\mathcal{H}_n$, and is a map from kets to other kets.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now include mixed states, allowing for non-unitary evolution, we must change formalism. Now, a state is represented by a *density operator* $\\rho=\\ket{\\psi}\\bra{\\psi}$, which is represented as an $n\\times n$ matrix. This is why they are also known as *density matrices*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It can be seen that some of the operators in the pure formalism can be seen as density matrices representing states. For example, the $X90$ operator corresponds to the state $\\ket{0}+\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is then how do we operate on these density matrices? A naïve way would be to simply change the way they operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A\\ket{\\psi}\\to A\\rho A^\\dag$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this does not offer much insight into the process. A better way is to use a representation known as a Pauli Transfer Matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PTMs\n",
    "\n",
    "> Go over this - in particular, why have the dimensions changed, and why is it a 4x4 matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a linear map $\\rho \\to \\Lambda(\\rho)$, acting on a Hilbert space which has some basis $P$. In 2D, this can be the Pauli set. For higher dimensions, we use the `generate_basis` function from `helpers.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we have a change of dimension: density matrices, which were $n\\times n$ matrices, become vectors of length $n^2$ on a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{n^2}$, and are written as superkets $\\ket{\\rho}\\rangle$. Operators become superoperators, and are represented by matrices of dimension $n^2\\times n^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this formalism, we can derive something called the Pauli Transfer Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(R_\\Lambda\\right)_{ij}=\\frac{1}{n}\\text{Tr }\\left[P_i\\Lambda\\left(P_j\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we find that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\Lambda(\\rho)}\\rangle=R_\\Lambda \\ket{\\rho}\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the superket after the map is found by multiplying the PTM by the superket before the map. This means if we can find the PTM for a given map (by finding the result of its application to the basis vectors) then we can find the result of the operation for *any* initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is now how to transfer from density matrices and operators to superkets and superoperators. We use a decomposition method to *vectorise* the matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the superket is a *vector* of length $n^2$ which has elements\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\rho}\\rangle_i=\\langle\\braket{k|\\rho}\\rangle=\\text{Tr }P_k\\rho$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $k\\equiv P_k$. That is, decompose the matrix $\\rho$ into the basis $P$, and then the superket represents these coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\rho}\\rangle=\\begin{pmatrix}0.5\\\\0\\\\0.2\\\\0.3\\end{pmatrix}\\implies \\rho =0.5P_0+0P_1+0.2P_2+0.3P_3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The PTM has a number of key properties which make it useful.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The elements satisfy $(R_\\Lambda)_{ij}\\in\\mathbb{R}, (R_\\Lambda)_{ij}\\in[-1, 1]$\n",
    " - The PTM of some composite map is equal to the product of the individual PTMs, which makes simulating a circuit easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, all maps $\\Lambda$ must be CPTP (completely positive (positive probabilities) and trace-preserving (probabilities add to 1)). This puts two requirements on $R_\\Lambda$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(R_\\Lambda\\right)_{0j}=\\delta_{0j}=(1,0,0,\\dots,0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second requirement is that we require $\\rho_\\Lambda$ to be positive semi-definite, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho_\\Lambda=\\frac{1}{d^2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^{d^2}{(R_\\Lambda)_{ij}P_j^T\\otimes P_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The map may also be unital, which means that it maps the identity to the identity, or equivalently, it does not make a state more pure. This can be visualised as the requirement that the zero vector on the Bloch sphere (maximally mixed state) is not mapped to a nonzero vector (less mixed state). If the map is unital, we find that the first *column* of $R_\\Lambda$ satisfies\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_{i0}=\\delta_{i0}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\\\\\vdots\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "does error analysis require me to change from a PTM to a process matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm I will use is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a transmon with some defined parameters\n",
    "2. Using pulse-level simulation, find the optimal pulse parameters to execute an X90 pulse. Initially start with $\\ket{0}$, but once the pulse is near-optimal, simulate a random starting state\n",
    "3. Calculate the PTM by running the pulse on all of the basis states\n",
    "4. Verify the PTM by comparing the simulated and pulse-level result for some initial state\n",
    "5. Analyse the PTM to correlate error sources and types?\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss this plan with Peter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner product of two vectors or matrices is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\braket{A|B}\\text{ or }\\langle\\braket{A|B}\\rangle = \\text{Tr } A^\\dag B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the expected value of any operator is\n",
